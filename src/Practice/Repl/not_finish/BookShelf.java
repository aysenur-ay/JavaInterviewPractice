/*
While writing his next book George wanted to program a digital representation of his book shelf, he already made a book class so he will be able to save the books title, author name, id, number of pages on the same object and manipulate it easily even if he has thousands of books.

Instead of using an array to hold the books he decided to put it in a class called Shelf representing a book shelf.

Shelf has a List of Book objects. Using static methods of Shelf class, George can add, remove, read, get title etc of the books.

Please carefully follow instructions in the classes.

Work on Book class first
